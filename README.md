2D Unity Game
=============

An experimental C# scripted side scroller to learn the features in Unity used to make a 2D game.

Used a number of online resources and completed a Udemy 2D tutorial called "Unity - 2D Side Scroller Course" which I then discovered is available free on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHPcpp4e3JVrhvssKEQiukFH2Crx_cf83

All the sprites, sounds and various assets are free and open source, mostly using the CC0 license and mostly from http://opengameart.org. One notable exception is the orc sprite which is CC-BY: SpriteAttack (no other attribution info was available).

Compiled working versions for both Windows and Android (although no controller for Android...).

# Instructions

As this was an experiment I don't expect anyone to actually play it!

However, if you insist then be prepared for some really bad game design and lots of weirdness as learning and experimenting was the priority. The most annoying being that the viewport is so close that you will struggle to see much around you, which means that you will not always see the next moving platform or where to go. Makes for a really punishing game and if you like frustrating experimental exploration by jumping around and probably dying a lot then you might actually like that.

The sticking to the platforms is also a bug that I decided to call a feature, so you can cling to platforms even if you fail to jump on.

There are 3 levels. To enter the door to each level press the "w" or "up" key. 


# Level 1

The first has three spawn points and enemies roaming about that will kill you if you touch them, but you can kill by jumping on top of their head. The second level you will reach by following all the platforms to the right and then up and to the left with lots of jumping. You will need to travel through level 1 to get to both level 2 and then back to level 3 and enemies will keep spawning...

# Level 2

No spoilers here, but basically you need to warp yourself and then return out where you came from and back down to the beginning.

# Level 3

Secret entrance to a parallax forest (aka garden) which you will only find after being warped on level 2.

# Controls

"p" pauses the game. Try it, the pause effect is probably the coolest thing about the game and kudos to the "Unity - 2D Side Scroller Course" for sharing. Simple, but cool.

"a" and "d" (or left and right keys) to move left and right, space to jump, and "w" (or up key) to enter doors.

The game will remember your last position, but you can reset that by exiting the game using "q" or escape key, or by simply pressing the "r" key.

# Closing Comments

Enjoy playing around with it and remember that this was about learning Unity 2D game development and NOT about game design.
